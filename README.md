# DevPal Social Media App

A user-focused platform that allows users to create an account and share posts with other users. Once users have created an account and logged in, they can create posts and choose whether to make them public or private. Public posts are visible to all users, while private posts are only visible to the creator and any users they choose to share them with. This app allows users to filter public posts by keyword and date to find the content they are interested in.
